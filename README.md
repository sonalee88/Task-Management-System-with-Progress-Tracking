# 🌟 TaskFlow - Personal Task Management System

> A personal productivity tool born out of real workflow needs, now refined into a feature-rich task management experience.

---

## 🎯 Why I Built This

As someone juggling multiple responsibilities, I found existing to-do apps either too basic or unnecessarily complex. I needed a system that:

- Helps prioritize what *actually matters*
- Motivates through *visible progress*
- Works seamlessly across *mobile and desktop*
- Evolves with *changing workflows*

After 6+ months of consistent usage and iteration, **TaskFlow** has become an indispensable part of how I organize and complete my work.
